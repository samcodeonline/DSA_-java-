This part is a bit trickier. Imagine adding a new car in the middle of the train, but you can only reach it by going through the existing cars. Here's what it does:

It first calls the length function to find the total number of cars in the train (size).
It checks if the position you entered to add the car is valid (between 1 and the total number of cars + 1). If not, it prints an error message and returns the head (without any changes).
It creates a new train car (newNode) with the information (data).
If you want to add at the very front (position == 1), it behaves just like insertAtBegining.
Otherwise, it uses two pointers:
previous: This points to the car right before the position where you want to add the new car.
current: This points to the car that will be after the new car.
It uses a loop (while) to move the previous pointer to the car before the desired position:
It starts a counter (count) at 1 and keeps moving previous to the next car (previous.next) until count reaches position-1 (one less than the desired position).
Now, previous points to the car before the insertion point, and current points to the car that will be after the new car.
It connects the new car (newNode) to the existing train by setting newNode.next to current.
Finally, it connects the car before (previous) to the new car by setting previous.next to newNode.
It returns the head (even though we added in the middle, the head remains the front).
